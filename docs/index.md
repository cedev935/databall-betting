Thank you for visiting my site, whose name was inspired by a [Grantland article](http://grantland.com/features/expected-value-possession-nba-analytics/). This site explores a project that combines my interest in data science with my love of sports. The discussion that follows details the process I used to predict game winners, from acquiring data to building models. Several of the pages on this site are converted from [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), in which case I provide a link to the original notebook hosted on [GitHub]({{ site.github.repository_url }}). My first foray into combining machine learning with sports came in the form of a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2014), where competitors were tasked with calculating the odds one team would beat another for each potential matchup of the NCAA men's basketball tournament. This permitted model confidence to be compared in addition to model accuracy. Predicting all possible matchups instead of filling out a traditional bracket also allowed submissions to be easily evaluated. It would otherwise have been difficult to determine who had the best model since filling out a perfect bracket is [near impossible](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-odds-youll-fill-out-a-perfect-bracket/). This project is a natural progression of that initial work.

As usual, there is a relevant [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) comic. Let's see what we learn!
