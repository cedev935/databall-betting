The world of sports betting can be very lucrative for those that are skilled at it. Nate Silver wrote that the sports bettor Haralabos Voulgaris makes a million dollars in a "bad" year[^a35eeb24]. This potential payout coupled with the perception that anyone can do it leads sports betting to be a big industry. An all-time high of $4.2 billion was bet on sports in Nevada in 2015, the sixth straight year a record amount was bet[^42676969]. However, it is difficult to be a successful sports bettor. Oddsmakers are very good at their jobs and teams' records against the spread do not typically deviate far from 50%. A good example of this is the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors, who set an NBA record for wins with 73. According to covers.com, they were a mere 45-35-2 against the spread and their over/under record was nearly identical at 45-36-1[^067f5b44], meaning their games hit the over 45 times. Betting on the spread involves picking winners of games with modified scores. For example, if a given team is favored by 5 points and wins by more than 5, they have "covered" and won against the spread. The betting line for this scenario will be set at -5 for the favorite. The opposite holds true for underdogs and losing by less than a positive line. The over/under requires comparing the total number of points scored by the two teams in a given game to a number set by the oddsmakers. Bettors must decide if they think the total points scored will be over or under this value. These provide more challenging problems than simply picking game winners. I plan to build models that predict NBA game winners against the spread and whether or not games will hit the over. These models will provide some guidance into which games are more promising to bet on.
