I chose basketball as a testbed for two main reasons. The first reason is that basketball is arguably the most deterministic of the major American professional sports, providing an easier first problem to tackle than other sports do. The best teams win more often than in other sports. At least one team wins more than 60 games (winning percentage of 73.2% in an 82 game season) nearly every season. Contrast that with baseball where randomness plays a much bigger role. Teams winning 100 games (winning percentage of 61.7% in a 162 game season) or more does happen, but not nearly as often. The best MLB teams typically win only about 60% of their games in a given season. A similar trend exists for the worst teams. The worst teams in the NBA win about 20% of their games, while the worst in MLB win about 40%. This results in a wider range of team performance in the NBA than in MLB. The NHL is also notoriously random. The best teams in the NFL often win a high percentage of their games, but the sample size in a given season is small at only 16 games. A team that goes on a lucky winning streak can have a record at season's end that is inflated compared to its underlying talent level.
