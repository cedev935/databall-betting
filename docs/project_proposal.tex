I chose basketball as a testbed for two main reasons. The first reason is that a wealth of NBA stats are readily available on the website \url{stats.nba.com}. The site exposes a wide variety of information in JSON format through various endpoints and parameters that take the form stats.nba.com/stats/{endpoint}/?{params}, making it easy to obtain the data programmatically. For example, individual player stats from every game so far this season can be found \href{http://stats.nba.com/stats/leaguegamelog/?LeagueID=00&Season=2016-17&SeasonType=Regular\%20Season&PlayerOrTeam=P&Sorter=PTS&Direction=DESC}{here}. I plan to pull the necessary  stats by utilizing an existing \href{https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py}{GitHub project} that provides a simple API and returns queries as Pandas DataFrames.

The second reason I chose to look at the NBA is that basketball is arguably the most deterministic of the major American professional sports. The best teams win more often than in other sports. At least one team wins more than 60 games (winning percentage of 73.2\% in an 82 game season) nearly every season. Contrast that with baseball where randomness plays a much bigger role. Teams winning 100 games (winning percentage of 61.7\% in a 162 game season) or more does happen, but not nearly as often. The best MLB teams typically win only about 60\% of their games in a given season. The NHL is also notoriously random. The best teams in the NFL win a high percentage of their games, but the sample size in a given season is small at only 16 games. A team that goes on a lucky winning streak can have a record at season?s end that is inflated compared to its underlying talent level.

I plan to combine the stats obtained above with spreads and over/under lines. Betting on the spread involves picking winners of games with modified scores. For example, if a given team is favored by 5 points and wins by more than 5, they have ?covered? and won against the spread. The betting line for this scenario will be set at -5 for the favorite. The opposite holds true for underdogs and losing by less than a positive line. The over/under requires comparing the total number of points scored by the two teams in a given game to a number set by the oddsmakers. Bettors must decide if they think the total points scored will be over or under this value. These provide more challenging problems than simply picking game winners. Oddsmakers are very good at their jobs and teams? records against the spread do not typically deviate far from 50\%. A good example of this is last season's Golden State Warriors. They set an NBA record for wins with 73, but were a mere 45-35-2 against the spread and their over/under record was nearly identical at 45-36-1 (their games hit the over 45 times). I will pull the spreads and over/under lines from \url{covers.com}. The site provides information going back to the 1990-91 season.

The first step is to build a classification model to predict NBA game winners given the strengths of the two teams in question. The model will be trained with games from previous seasons and tested against games already played this season. The second step involves predicting winners against the spread and over/unders. I am interested in comparing the performance of the models using both team stats and player stats. The absence of a team?s best player generally affects an NBA team more than teams in other sports. This would be reflected in the betting lines. Only using team stats to model team strength would not pick up on this. Building a model using player stats from the players available would better account for this.
